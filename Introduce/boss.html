<h3><strong>The Beginning</strong></h3>

<p>I lucked out and got a fabulous job right out of 
        college at <a href="https://luriechildrens.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/">Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals</a> based in 
        Salt Lake City, Utah. I enjoyed 10+ years working in various 
        communications, public relations and innovation positions. It was a 
        joy to spend every day working to help children’s hospitals throughout 
        the U.S. and Canada.  
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        One of the highlights of this job was each year taking a child
        from each state to meet their senators and The President of The United States in Washington, D.C.
        It was an unparalleled experience to work with such amazing children
        who had overcome immense health challenges.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Another highlight was in 2011 CMN Hospitals made a bold move in the nonprofit world by 
        creating a high-level, cross-functional team dedicated entirely to 
        innovation. I was privileged to be a part of the team. My 
        responsibilities included human-centered research, ideation, 
        conceptualization, prototyping, test management and execution. 
        I loved being introduced to the design thinking field and the power of
        user-centered design.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Also during this time I taught PR and Communications classes at my local community college. 
I loved teaching.

    <h3><strong>The Middle</strong></h3>
    <img src="FirstClass.png" alt="First Class" style="float:right;width:300px; height:auto;padding-left: 20px ;">
    The last six years, I took a brief break from full-time employment 
    to fully immerse myself in the ultimate creative endeavor...raising three 
    children.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    During this time my husband and I started a niche real estate company called 
    <a href="http://www.firstclasscrashpads.com/">First Class Crashpads</a>
    that accommodates pilots and flight attendants based in Chicago. We 
    started out renting to 20 people and now we own three buildings and rent to 
    100 airline crews. We’ve also developed the strongest brand and web presence 
    for this niche market in Chicago.

    <h3><strong>The Next Step</strong></h3>
<p>Owning a small business has been an eye-opening experience that has highlighted some 
    communication opportunities in the small-business sector of the economy.
    To capitalize on those opportunities, I'm currently polishing my 
    communication and design skills by pursuing a Graphic Design certificate. I'd like to help other 
    small businesses with their communication, writing and design 
    needs.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    After finishing my certificate I've also contemplated pursuing another 
    masters degree or PHD in Design Thinking or Communications.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    I'm also interested in teaching again at the college level.
