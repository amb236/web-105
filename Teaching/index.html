                <h3>Planning Your Book Club</h3>
                <p>It's important to figure out exatly what you'd like your book club to
                    be like first. Here are some important things to consider:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who do you want to participate?</li>
                    <li>How do you want to select books?</li>
                    <li>How often do you want to meet?</li>
                    <li>Where will you meet?</li>
                    <li>What will your meetings look like?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Inviting Members</h3>
                        <p>A book club is only as good as it's participants. Take care to chat with friends
                            and family who might have interest. Book lovers are easy to find when
                            you simply ask "What have you been reading lately?" When you have an 
                            idea of who you'd like to invite, create special invitations to a kick-off event.
                            Invitations don't need to be fancy, but they set the tone for your club, get people excited 
                            and can help members know what is expected.

                <h3>Inaugural Event</h3>
                        <p>Now's the fun part! Decide whether you'd life food or drinks to play a part
                            in your book club. Your opening event should set the standard and tone
                            for future meetings. Also, make sure you begin to invite those in your group to 
                            participate in the meetings and execution of the events. 
                            You might invite members to bring food, host, discuss a 
                            certain book, etc. When many members have responsibilies it can take pressure of the 
                            organizer and help everyone feel invested in the success of your club.

                <h3>Talk Books!</h3>
                        <p>Now you can dig into the best part of your club...talking about books.
                            At your initial meeting work with your members to decide how to pick books,
                            discuss them and set up a calendar. An idea for your kick-off meeting is to have
                            everyone share a book that has impacted their life, or a childhood favorite, etc. 
                            You can also have door prizes and book-related games and food.

                <h3>Communicate</h3>
                        <p>One of the keys for the long-term success of your book club is communication. 
                            It is vital that one member of the club be responsible for
                            communicating with members about book picks, meeting times, etc. Consistent and 
                            frequent communication will help your member stay informed and engaged.
