                <p>
                    This was done with a div and a class in the header. I'm also trying a <span style="border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; background-color: lightblue;">span</span> with 
                    a blue background and padding.

                <main>
                    <h3 class="pink">Block Elements</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a regular paragraph within a "main" block element. A "main" block element
                        is unique to just one page and shouldn't contain elements that are repeated on other pages.
                    </p>
                    <p><small>
                        This is the another paragraph, but I used the "Small" inline style.</small>
                    </p>
                    <p>I love this JFK quote that I'm turning it into a "blockquote."

                    <blockquote class="block" cite="https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.html">We choose to go to the moon. 
                        We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the 
                        other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, </blockquote>

                <section>
                    <h3 class="darkb"; id="s1">Section</h3>
                        <p>This is my <span class="pink">FIRST SECTION </span>. It is a block element. Sections can be 
                            chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of a document.
                        </p>

                <Section>
                    <h3 class="darkb">Time & Big </h3>
                    <p>I can see why the date and time inline code could be helpful. Especially since today is <time datetime="2008-03-09 20:00">March 9</time>. I also think it could 
                    be fun to play with the <big>Big</big> and <small>Small</small> elements. However it looks like
                the big element isn't working correctly.</p>
