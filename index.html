    <H3>Summary</h3>
    <p>In the somewhat near future, in the city of Chicago, <strong>Meri Beckley</strong> 
does a simple internet search of a word she didn't know: <strong>Verify</strong>. Her simple query ignited
a chain of events that revealed a darkness she never imagined.
    </p>
    <p>Meri learns that her mother, who was reportedly killed by a drunk driver,
        may have been part of a secret sect of society. The sect had stockpiled physical books,
        a crime of the highest order. Books, paper and anything non-digital was outlawed
        and considered dangerous and careless. Meri's mom had learned about this special
        group of people who were safegaurding the world's written knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>Meri is contacted about becoming part of this secret sect, which compares itself to the <strong>Underground Railroad</strong> from history. 
        She learns that in the name of peace, prosperity and natural preservation, the government 
        had instituted rules against owning anything on paper. By doing so they had begun
        to control all narratives, because they could change any word, any reference because it
        was digitally vunerable. Words such as <i>Verify, Resistance, and Movement</i> were eliminated
        from all texts and basically became obsolete. History books were whitewashed, leaving new generations
        totally oblivious to the richness and conflicts of the past. Things appeared Utopian, but 
        in fact they were just an illusion.
    </p>
    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
    <p>I thought this was a super interesting book and definitely worth reading. The concept
        was interesting, despite the writing being pretty simplistic
        and vanilla. It is an incredibly timely novel that everyone could benefit
        from reading. If nothing else, it will make you just want to curl up
        and enjoy a good, hard-bound book.
    </p>
    <h3>What Others Are Saying</h3>
    <p><blockquote><q>Wow! Shades of Fahrenheit 451 
        and Orwell’s 1984. Painfully real and urgent. Read this book. —Michael Grant, New York Times 
        bestselling author of the Gone series</q></blockquote></p>
