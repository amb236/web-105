            <p>I'm a writer, designer, innovator and communicator. I'm passionate about helping meaningful organization's find their voice and communicate their mission. My most significant employment experience was working for 10+ years at an international children's healthcare charity in communications, public relations and innovation roles.
            </p>
            <p>
I took a brief break from full-time employment to fully immerse myself in the ultimate creative endeavor...raising three children.
</p>
<p>During that time my husband and I started a small business. Owning a business was an eye-opening experience that illuminated some communication opportunities in that sector of the economy.
</p>
​<p>
    To capitalize on those opportunities I am currently polishing my communication and design skills by pursuing a Graphic Design Certificate at McHenry County College. My ultimate goal is to help small businesses and other meaningful organizations with their communication, writing and design needs.
