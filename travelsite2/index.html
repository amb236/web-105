            <h3><strong>The Castle</strong></h3>
            <p class="asidetext"> The most visual and stunning part
                of Edinburgh, Scotland, is it's iconic castle. The 
                castle sits up on a large rocky hill right in the middle of the city.
                The castle has played a huge role in many of Scotland's most historic
                moments in history. It has been a royal residence since the 12th century. 
                Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to her only son in the Castle. 
            </p>
            <p class="asidetext">
                When I visited the castle, I was blown away by how old everything was. Nothing
                in America has such ancient history. I loved the beautiful Great Hall and
                visiting "the dungeons". It is a remarkable place to visit and imagine all
                the incredible history of the Scotland area.
