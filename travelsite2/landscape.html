            <h3><strong>The Landscape</strong></h3>
            <p class="asidetext"> The landscape of Scotland is stunning. When you visit
                the castle, you can truly take in the amazing landscape that surrounds the urban city.
                It makes you want to get out of the city and go exploring. Which is 
                exactly what we did. 
            </p>
            <p class="asidetext">
                We took a day-trip tour through the countryside and highlands of Scotland. It was
                as breathtaking as you can imagine. We saw highland cows, iconic movie sets, and endless 
                green hills and valleys. Everything was incredibly green. The highlight of our
                countryside tour was a visit to Loch Ness. It was a quaint, beautiful town. 
                Unfortunately, we didn't see Nessie, the Loch Ness monster, but maybe another day!
