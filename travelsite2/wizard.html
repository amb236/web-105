            <h3><strong>The Wizard</strong></h3>
            <p class="asidetext"> I didn't know it until after I arrived,
                but J.K. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book in Edinburgh. Many 
                of the places in the book are based on places and artifacts in, and around, Edinburgh.
                I didn't understand why there were so many Harry Potter gift shops until I did a little research
                and discovered the connection. 
            </p>
            <p class="asidetext">
                It turns out our hotel was just a 3-minute walk away from "The Elephant House," 
                which is where Rowling spent many hours writing from the cafe's table. My husband and I 
                were lucky enough to be seated in the back of the cafe, with a view of Edinburgh Castle, out the window.
                It was incredibly cool to visualize Rowling sitting at that very table, using the Castle out the window
                as inspiration for Hogwarts.
            </p>
            <p class="asidetext">
                We also learned that a really beautiful street, Victoria street, that we walked through on the way
                to The Elephant House was also the inspiration for Diagon Alley. Many of the shops
                on the street claim to be the inspiration for various places and shops described in the books.
